    <h1>My main title</h1>
    <p>This is Barkles: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>a floofy potato with legs</li>
        <li>thinks he's a majestic wolf</li> 
        <li>cries when his squeaky toy gets stuck under the couch</li>
    </ul>
    <p>His hobbies include: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>zooming at 3 AM like a cracked-out kangaroo</li>
        <li>sneak-attacking socks</li>
        <li>giving you the judgmental side-eye when you eat without sharing</li>

    </ul>
    <p>He's 10% dog, 90% chaos, and 100% certified good boy, even though he once tried to eat a bee and lost the fight.</p>
